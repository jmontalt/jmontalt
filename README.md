### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a researcher at UCL, interested in MR image acquisition and processing and biomedical ML/AI applications.

Most of my activity can be found in my research group's [organization](https://github.com/mrphys).

I maintain [TensorFlow MRI](https://github.com/mrphys/tensorflow-mri) and [TensorFlow NUFFT](https://github.com/mrphys/tensorflow-nufft).
